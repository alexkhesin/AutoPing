# AutoPing

A macOS menu bar widget which shows a weighted moving average of recent ping times and packet loss (percentage of failed pings) if any, helpful for monitoring health of computer's internet connection. Inspired by a [similar utility published by Memset in 2010s](https://web.archive.org/web/20160410212547/https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/autoping/id632347870?mt=12). I was sad to let it go and had to build something similar.

Minimum required macOS version is 15.5.
